# Sorting algorithms

## General

### At least four different sorting algorithms
- Insertion 
- Selection 
- Bubble
- Shell 

### What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
Big O notation is a way to express the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm based on the input size. It tells you how the running time of an algorithm scales as the input grows.
* O(1): Constant time - The algorithm's runtime is consistent, regardless of input size.

* O(log n): Logarithmic time - As input grows, the runtime increases slowly, often seen in efficient search and divide-and-conquer algorithms.

* O(n): Linear time - The runtime grows linearly with input size; doubling input usually doubles runtime.

* O(n log n): Linearithmic time - Slightly faster than quadratic; common in efficient sorting algorithms.

* O(n^2): Quadratic time - The runtime grows with the square of input size, making it slower as input increases.

* O(2^n): Exponential time - The runtime grows rapidly with input, usually impractical for larger inputs.

* O(n!): Factorial time - The runtime grows at an even faster rate than exponential, typically very slow and impractical.
